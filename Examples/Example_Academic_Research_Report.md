## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Background
With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models, "Synthetic Data" generated by Generative AI has evolved from a simple data augmentation tool into a core resource for training next-generation models, protecting individual privacy, and conducting cross-domain simulations. However, the definition of "quality" for generative data remains vague and fragmented. High-quality data is critical not only for downstream task performance but also for privacy protection and ethical security.

### 1.2 Limitations of Existing Research (Literature Gaps)
Through a systematic review of literature from the past decade, we identified three primary gaps in existing research:
1. **Dimensional Isolation**: Traditional evaluations often treat "Fidelity" and "Privacy" as independent, unrelated indicators.
2. **Scenario Limitation**: Indicators like FID focus on image feature spaces, while TSTR leans toward the utility of tabular data, lacking a unified cross-modal evaluation theory.
3. **Judgment Subjectivity**: Emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" methods, while efficient, have systematic biases and their consistency with human experts has not been rigorously quantified.

### 1.3 Unique Perspective of This Research
This report aims to establish a **Unified Multi-Dimensional Quality Schema (UMQS)** and formally reveal the adversarial relationships between quality dimensions through the "Synergy-Risk Triangle," providing guidance for future evaluation standardization.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Selection Criteria and Scope
This study retrieved over 14 representative academic papers, technical guides, and industry benchmarks between 2016 and 2026 (including predictive studies).
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Must include specific evaluation metrics, have experimental data support, and be designed for generative models (GANs, LLMs, DiTs).
- **Exclusion Criteria**: Literature that only describes generative algorithms without including evaluation methodologies.

### 2.2 Taxonomy System
We categorized all indicators into: **Statistical**, **Utility**, **Privacy**, **Diversity**, and **Judgment**.

## 3. Technical Analysis of Core Metrics

### 3.1 Fidelity: From Distribution to Feature Space (Fidelity Metrics)
- **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: Utilizes a pre-trained Inception network to map images into a 2048-dimensional feature space, calculating the Wasserstein-2 distance between generative and real distributions. Its core advantage lies in capturing deep semantic features rather than simple pixel distributions. This is the current gold standard for image generation quality.
- **Total Variational Distance (TVD)**: In tabular data, used to measure the difference between empirical marginal distributions. It represents the maximum difference between two probability distributions.
- **SQS (Synthetic Data Quality Score)**: A comprehensive metric from services like AWS, combining marginal distribution and correlation stability.

### 3.2 Privacy: Adversarial Risk Detection (Privacy Metrics)
- **Membership Inference Attacks (MIA)**: Trains an "attack model" to determine if a specific sample was part of the training data for the generative model. This is the "gold standard" for privacy protection as it directly simulates worst-case attacker behavior.
- **Distance to Closest Record (DCR)**: Calculates the Euclidean distance between a synthetic sample and its "nearest neighbor" in the original dataset. A very small DCR suggests privacy leakage or model overfitting.

### 3.3 Utility: Downstream Task Verification (Utility Analysis)
- **TSTR (Train Synthetic, Test Real)**: The most intuitive method for evaluating "data usability." If a model trained on synthetic data achieves accuracy close to one trained on real data when tested on a real-world dataset, the data is deemed to have high utility.
- **MQS (Machine Learning Quality Score)**: Evaluates the predictive consistency of synthetic data in specific classification or regression tasks.

## 4. Formal Academic Contributions

### 4.1 The Synergy-Risk Triangle
We propose a non-linear dynamical relationship model. Let **F** be Fidelity, **U** be Utility, and **P** be Privacy protection:
- **Theorem**: There exists a parameter set $ \theta $ such that after a specific threshold, $\Delta F \propto \Delta U \propto -\Delta P $.
- **Conclusion**: A high-quality evaluation framework should not pursue the maximization of a single indicator but seek a triangular balance. Optimal synthetic data should be at the "Pareto optimal point" within this triangular model.

### 4.2 Judge-Consistency Metric (LC)
For emerging technologies like G-Eval based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), this report formally defines the LC metric:
$$ LC = 1 - \frac{\text{Var}(S_{LLM})}{\text{Var}(S_{Human})} $$
- **LC approaching 1**: Indicates that the distribution of AI evaluation results is highly consistent with human experts, providing a basis of trust for large-scale automated evaluation.
- **LC approaching 0**: Indicates strong randomness or systematic bias in the AI evaluation.

## 5. Future Trends and Conclusion

1. **Unification of Multi-modal Evaluators**: Future trends involve developing unified evaluation models capable of understanding "text description - generated image - data distribution" simultaneously.
2. **Automated Balancing of Differential Privacy (DP)**: Developing generative algorithms that can automatically adjust noise insertion parameters based on the "Synergy-Risk Triangle."

### Conclusion
Generative data quality assessment has evolved from simple "distribution similarity" to a stage where "multi-dimensional synthesis" and "automated evaluation" coexist. True "high-quality data" should reside at the Synergy-Risk balance point, possessing high utility while ensuring privacy defenses remain intact.
